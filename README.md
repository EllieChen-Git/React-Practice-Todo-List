### Tutorial I followed: [Learn React JS - Full Course for Beginners - Tutorial 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&list=WL&index=8&t=12321s)

Ellie's note: I only followed the to-do list challenge, but I think this is a very comprehensive tutorial with lots of hands-on practice. Would recommend this to people who just start learning React.
